Packer Templates
================

A few [Packer](http://www.packer.io/) templates I use.

## Usage

I normally just download the ISO and put it in the same directory as the packer
template for that platform (git-ignored).  Packer apparently also does caching
but I normally just download the image myself since I use it for other things
besides Packer.  The original iso urls are generally put into the `_iso_url`
user variable.
