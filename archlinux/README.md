ArchLinux Packer Template
=========================

Heavily inspired by the [packer-arch
repo](https://github.com/elasticdog/packer-arch) but with a few tweaks like
using MBR over GPT.

Relies on a [fork of packer](https://github.com/qur/packer/tree/libvirt) to add
libvirt support until it is (hopefully) merged into the main project.
